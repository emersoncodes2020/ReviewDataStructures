## Data Structure and Abstract Data Type

A data Structure (DS) is a way of organizing data so that it can be used 
efficiently and effectively.

An abstract data type (ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the 
interface to which a data structure must adhere to.

    - The interface does not give any specific details about how something should be
    implemented or in what programming language.

    Examples

    (ADT) Abstraction   |    (DS) Implementation
    ---------------------------------------------
    List                |       Dynamic array / Linked List
    Queue               |       Linked List Queue / Array Based Queue / Stack based Queue
    Map                 |       tree map/ Hash table / Hash Map


## Big O / Computational Complexity Analysis

Big-O Notation: gives an upper bound of the complexity in the worst case,
helping to quantify performance as the input size becomes arbitrarily large.

n = The size of the input

Complexities ordered from smallest to largest:

smallest        Constant: O(1)
                Logarithmic: O(log(n))
                Linear: O(n)
                Linearithmic: O(nlog(n))
                Quadratic: O(n^2)
                Cubic: O(n^3)
                Exponential: O(b^n), b > 1
largest         Factorial: O(n!)

## Static and Dynamic Arrays

Static Array: is a fixed length container containing n elements indexable(means each 
slot/index in the array can be referenced with a number) from the range [0, n-1].

Static Array Usage
    1) Storing/accessing sequential data.
    2) temporarily storing objects.
    3) Used by IO routines as buffers.
    4) lookup tables and inverse lookup tables.
    5) return multiple values from a function.
    6) Used in dynamic programming to cache answers to subproblems.

Complexity

                |   Static Array    |       Dynamic Array
--------------------------------------------------------------
accessing       |   O(1)            |       O(1) constant
search          |   O(n)            |       O(n) linear
insertion       |   n/a             |       O(n) linear
appending       |   n/a             |       O(n) linear
deletion        |   n/a             |       O(1) constant

Dynamic Array: can grow and shrink in size.

Dynamic Array Usage
    1) Create a static arry with an initial capacity.
    2) Add elements to the underlying static array. (Keeping track of 
        the number of elements.)
    3) If adding another element will exceed the capacity, then create a new static
        array with twice the capacity and copy the original elements into it.

## Singly and Doubly Linked Lists

Linked List: is a sequential list of nodes that hold data which point to other
nodes also containing data.

Singly

    x -------> x -------> x -----------> x
    data    data        data            null

Linked List Usage
    1) Used in many list, queue and stack implementations
    2) Great for creating circular lists.
    3) Can easily model real world objects such as trains.
    4) Used in separating chaining, which is present in certain Hashtable implementations
        to deal with hashing collissions.
    5) Often used in the implementation of adjacency lists for graphs.

Terminology
    1) Head: the first node in a linked list
    2) Tail: The last node in a linked list
    3) Pointer: Reference to another node
    4) Node: An object containing data and pointer(s)


        3 -----> 84 -----> 85 -----> 21 -----> 31
      Head            Pointer       node      Tail

Singly Linked List: only holds a reference to the next node. You will always maintain
a reference to the head and a reference to the tail node for quick additions/ removals.

Doubly Linked List: holds a reference to the next and previous node. You will always
maintain a reference to the head and the tail of the doubly linked list to do quick
additions/removals from both ends of your list.

## Singly & Doubly Linked Lists Pros and Cons

            |     Pros            |      Cons
---------------------------------------------------
Singly      | Uses less memory    |  Cannot easily
Linked      | simpler             |  access previous
List        | implementation      |  elements
---------------------------------------------------
doubly      | can be traversed    | Takes 2x
Linked      | backwards           | memory
List        |                     |

Complexity for Linked Lists

            |   Singly Linked     |  Doubly Linked
------------------------------------------------------
search      |   O(n) linear       |    O(n) linear
------------------------------------------------------
Insert at   |   O(1) Constant     |    O(1) constant
head        |                     |                 
------------------------------------------------------
Insert at   |   O(1) constant     |     O(1) constant

------------------------------------------------------

## Stack

Stack: is a one-ended linear data structure which mode is a real world stack by having
two primary operations, namely push and pop. (last in first out)

When and where Stacks are used
    1) Used by undo mechanisms in text editors
    2) used in compiler syntax checking for matching brackets and braces.
    3) Can be used to model a pile of books or plates.
    4) Used behind the scenes to support recursion by keeping track of previous function
        calls.
    5) Can be used to do a Depth First Search (DFS) on a graph.

Complexity (Stacks)

    Pushing     | O(1) constant
    Popping     | O(1) constant
    Peeking     | O(1) constant
    Searching   | O(n) linear
    Size        | O(1) constant

## Queues

Queues: are a linear data structure which models real world queues by having two 
primary operations, namely enqueue and dequeue.

Terminology
Enqueue: Adding = offering (adding to the back)
Dequeue: Polling (remove from front)

Queue Usage
    1) Any waiting line models a queue, for example a lineup at a theme park.
    2) Can be used to efficiently keep track of the x most recently added elements.
    3) Web server request management where you want first come first serve.
    4) Breadth first search(BFS) graph traversal


Complexity (Queues)

    Enqueue     | O(1) constant
    Dequeue     | O(1) constant
    Peeking     | O(1) constant (looking at front queue without removal)
    Contains    | O(n) linear (looking to see if value is within queue)
    Removal     | O(n) linear
    IsEmpty     | O(1) constant

## Breadth First Search

Concept: traverse nodes within graph from starting node till none are left.

example:
    Let Q be a queue
        Q.enqueue(start_node)
        start_node.visited = true

        while Q is not empty Do
            node = Q.dequeue()

    For neighbor in neighbors(node):
        if neighbor has not been visited:
            neighbor.visited = true
                Q.enqueue(neighbor)

## Priority Queues (PQs) with an intro to Heaps

Priority Queues: is an abstract data type (ADT) that operates similar to a normal queue
except that each element has a certain priority.

the priority elements in the priority queue determine the order in which elements are
removed from the PQ.

NOTE:: Priority Queues only supports comparable data, meaning the data inserted in the 
PQ must be able to be ordered in some way either from least to greatest or greatest to
least. This is so we are able to assign relative priorities to each element.

poll() = remove the highest priority element

poll rest guesses what next priority element is but doesn't guarantee an order for the Queue
it uses a heap in this instance.

## Heaps

Heap: is a tree based data structure that satisfies the heap invariant (also called Heap
property).

If A is a parent node of B then A is ordered with respect to B for all nodes A, B in the
heap.

Max heap: the parent is greater than the children values
Min heap: the parent is less than the children values.

Priority Queue Usage
    1) used in certain implementations of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.
    2) Anytime you need the dynamically fetch the 'next best' or 'next worst' element
    3) used in huffman coding ( which is often used for lossless data comparison)
    4) Best First Search (BFS) algorithms such as A* use PQs to continuously grab the 
    next most promising node.
    5) Used by minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm

Complexity (Priority Queues)

    Binary Heap Construction    |   O(n) linear
    ------------------------------------------------------
    Polling                     |   O(log(n)) Logarithmic
    ------------------------------------------------------
    Peeking                     |   O(1) constant
    ------------------------------------------------------
    Adding                      |   O(log(n)) Logarithmic
    ------------------------------------------------------
    Naive Removing              |   O(n) linear
    ------------------------------------------------------
    Advanced Removing with      |   O(log(n)) Logarithmic
    help from a hash table      |
    ------------------------------------------------------
    Naive Contains              |   O(n)
    ------------------------------------------------------
    contains check with help    |   O(1)
    of a hash table             |
    ------------------------------------------------------

    NOTE:: using a hash table to help optimize these operations does take up linear
    space and also adds some overhead to the binary heap implementation.

## Turning Min Priority Queue into Max Priority Queues

Problem: Often the standard library of most programming languages only provide a minimum
priority queue which sorts by smallest elements first, but sometimes we need a Max
priority queue.

    - Since elements in a priority queue are comparable they implement some sort of
    comparable interface which we can simply negate to achieve a max heap.

Example: Let x, y be numbers in the PQ. For a min PQ, if x <= y then x comes out of the
PQ before y, so the negation of this is if x >= y then y comes out before x.

## Adding Elements to Binary Heap
    # Ways of Implementing a Priority Queue

Priority Queues are usually implemented with heaps since this gives them the best
possible time complexity.

The PQ is an ADT, hence heaps are not the only way to implement PQs.

Example: we could use an unsorted list, but this would not give us the best possible
time complexity.

## Priority Queue with Binary Heap

There are many types of heaps we could use to implement a priority queue:
    1) Binary Heap
    2) Fibonacci Heap
    3) Binomial Heap
    4) Pairing Heap

Binary Heap: is a binary tree that supports the heap invariant. In a binary tree every
node has exactly two children.

Binary Heap: is a heap where every node has exactly two children

Complete binary tree: is a tree in which at every level, except possibly the last is 
completely filled and all the nodes are as far left as possible.

## Removing Elements From Binary Heap

In general with heaps we always want to remove the root value because its the node
of interest.
