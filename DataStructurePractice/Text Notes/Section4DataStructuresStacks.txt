Section 4: Data Structures - Stacks

    ## implement the undo feature
    ## build compilers (syntax checking)
    ## evaluate expressions (1+2*3)
    ## build navigation (eg forward/back)

    think of a stack of books. You can only review what's on top

    Last In First Out (LIFO)

    example:

    [action3]
    [action2]
    [action1]

    Operations
        push(item) O(1)
        pop() O(1)
        peek() O(1)
        isEmpty() O(1)
    
    Reversing a String exercise

    String str = "abcd";

    Balanced Expression exercise

    Summary:
        Last-In First-Out (LIFO)
        Can be implemented using Arrays / Linked Lists
        All operations run in O(1)
