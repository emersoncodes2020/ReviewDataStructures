Section 2: Data Structures - Arrays

    ## organizes data sequentially

    Complexity for Arrays:
        lookup O(1)
        insert O(n)
        remove Best: O(1) Worst: O(n)

    ## length/size of array cannot change in Java its fixed in size.

    Build a Array:
        public class MyArray {
            private int length;
            private int[] data;
            private int index;

            public MyArray(length, data){
                this.length = 0;
                this.data = {};
            }

            public void get(index) {
                return this.data[index];
            }
        }
    
    Static vs dynamic arrays
        ## static = fixed in size/length
        ## dynamic = copy and rebuild/ can resize itself

    Dynamic Arrays
        ## import java.util = vector 100% when full- A single thread synchronized can
            access at a time
        ## ArrayList = has methods like add, remove, indexOf, lastIndexOf, size, toArray
