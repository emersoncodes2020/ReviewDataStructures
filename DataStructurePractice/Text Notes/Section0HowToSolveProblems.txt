Section 0: How to Solve Problems

    Step 1: Verify the constraints

        ## Are all the numbers positive or can there be negatives?
        ## Are there duplicate numbers in the array?
        ## will there always be a solution available?
        ## what do we return if theres no solution?
        ## can there be multiple pairs that add up to the target?

    Step 2: Write out some Test causes

        ## constraints
            1) All numbers are positive
            2) No, there are no duplicates
            3) Just return null
            4) yes, there is always a solution
            5) No, only 1 pair of numbers add up to the target.
        
        ## Best Case testcases
            1) [1,2,3,7,9,2] t=11 [3,4]
            2) [1,3,7,9,2] t=25 null
            3) [] t=1 null
            4) [5] t=5 null ** need two indices
            5) [1,6] t=7 [0,1]

    Step 3: Figure out a solution without compared
        
        ## pseudocode

    Step 4: Write out our solution in code

        ## actual java code now

    Step 5: double check for errors

        ## make sure the code is exactly as it should be.
        ## check for spelling errors or missing brackets or semicolons.

    Step 6: Test our code with our test cases (see step 2)

    Step 7: Space and Time Complexity

    Step 8: Can we optimize our solution?
